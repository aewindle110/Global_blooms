# Global algal blooms

This repo contains the scripts used in "Widespread global increase in intense lake phytoplankton blooms since the 1980s" (Ho, Michalak, Pahlevan, 2019) published in Nature. Full-text access to a view-only version of the paper is located [here](http://rdcu.be/bUfIR), or at this link: [http://rdcu.be/bUfIR](http://rdcu.be/bUfIR)

Currently, only the Python script for the Google Earth Engine code applied to all lakes are in the repo. The remaining scripts that contain statistical analyses, figure creation, etc. will be added shortly.

Note that the since these analyses were first performed, the Earth Engine Landsat 5 ImageCollection containing the FMask bands were removed, and some modifications to the code will be necessary.
